# Our objective

The creation of the Machine Learning models and processing pipeline to acquire, preprocess, extract, model, and recommend companies and people as Sales leads. The project covered gathering business requirements, data exploration of what is possible, designing the ML architecture, creation of many datasets and data labeling pipelines, and of course, the implementation of a recommendation model.
