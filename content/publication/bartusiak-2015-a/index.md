abstract: A method for sentiment polarity assignment for textual content written in
  Polish using supervised machine learning approach with transfer learning scheme
  is proposed in the paper. It has been shown that performing simple natural language
  processing steps prior to classification, provides inspiring results without redundant
  computation overhead. The documents containing subjective opinions were classified
  using N-gram and Bi-gram language model that is able to encode some of complex word
  phrases. The experiments carried out on two real datasets taken from different domains
  proved that learning on one dataset and testing on another, which is commonly called
  transfer learning, can be effective and may result in very high classification quality.
