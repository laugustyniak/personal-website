abstract:
  We propose a novel approach to generate aspect hierarchies that proved to
  be consistently correct compared with human-generated hierarchies. We present an
  unsupervised technique using Rhetorical Structure Theory and graph analysis. We
  evaluated our approach based on 100,000 reviews from Amazon and achieved an astonishing
  80% coverage compared with human-generated hierarchies coded in ConceptNet. The
  method could be easily extended with a sentiment analysis model and used to describe
  sentiment on different levels of aspect granularity. Hence, besides the flat aspect
  structure, we can differentiate between aspects and describe if the charging aspect
  is related to battery or price.
