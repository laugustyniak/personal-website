  abstract  = {Political campaigns are full of political ads posted by candidates on social media. Political advertisements constitute a basic form of campaigning, subjected to various social requirements. We present the first publicly open dataset for detecting specific text chunks and categories of political advertising in the Polish language. It contains 1,705 human-annotated tweets tagged with nine categories, which constitute campaigning under Polish electoral law. We achieved a 0.65 inter-annotator agreement (Cohen{'}s kappa score). An additional annotator resolved the mismatches between the first two annotators improving the consistency and complexity of the annotation process. We used the newly created dataset to train a well established neural tagger (achieving a 70{\%} percent points F1 score). We also present a possible direction of use cases for such datasets and models with an initial analysis of the Polish 2020 Presidential Elections on Twitter.}

  abstract      = {We propose a novel method for counting sentiment orientation that outperforms supervised learning approaches in time and memory complexity and is not statistically significantly different from them in accuracy. Our method consists of a novel approach to generating unigram, bigram and trigram lexicons. The proposed method, called frequentiment, is based on calculating the frequency of features (words) in the document and averaging their impact on the sentiment score as opposed to documents that do not contain these features. Afterwards, we use ensemble classification to improve the overall accuracy of the method. What is important is that the frequentiment-based lexicons with sentiment threshold selection outperform other popular lexicons and some supervised learners, while being 3-5 times faster than the supervised approach. We compare 37 methods (lexicons, ensembles with lexicon's predictions as input and supervised learners) applied to 10 Amazon review data sets and provide the first statistical comparison of the sentiment annotation methods that include ensemble approaches. It is one of the most comprehensive comparisons of domain sentiment analysis in the literature.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we present a method for correcting automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors using a finite state transducer (FST) intent recognition framework. Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog flow management in turn-oriented, human-machine dialogs. This technique can also be very useful in the context of human-human dialogs, though it serves a different purpose of key insight extraction from conversations. We argue that currently available intent recognition techniques are not applicable to human-human dialogs due to the complex structure of turn-taking and various disfluencies encountered in spontaneous conversations, exacerbated by speech recognition errors and scarcity of domain-specific labeled data. Without efficient key insight extraction techniques, raw human-human dialog transcripts remain significantly unexploited. Our contribution consists of a novel FST for intent indexing and an algorithm for fuzzy intent search over the lattice - a compact graph encoding of ASR's hypotheses. We also develop a pruning strategy to constrain the fuzziness of the FST index search. Extracted intents represent linguistic domain knowledge and help us improve (rescore) the original transcript. We compare our method with a baseline, which uses only the most likely transcript hypothesis (best path), and find an increase in the total number of recognized intents by 25.1{\%}.},

  abstract      = {The complex nature of big data resources requires new structuring methods, especially for textual content. WordNet is a good knowledge source for the comprehensive abstraction of natural language as it offers good implementation for many languages. Since WordNet embeds natural language in the form of a complex network, a transformation mechanism, WordNet2Vec, is proposed in this paper. This creates vectors for each word from WordNet. These vectors encapsulate a general position — the role of a given word related to all other words in the given natural language. Any list or set of such vectors contains knowledge about the context of its components within the whole language. This type of word representation can be easily applied to many analytic tasks such as classification or clustering. The usefulness of the WordNet2Vec method is demonstrated in sentiment analysis including the classification of an Amazon opinion text dataset with transfer learning.},

However, there is still a lack of wide and comprehensive studies of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). We want to fill this gap and propose a comparison with ablation analysis of aspect term extraction using various text embedding methods. We particularly focused on architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with optional conditional random field (CRF) enhancement using different pre-trained word embeddings. Moreover, we analyzed the influence on performance of extending the word vectorization step with character embedding. The experimental results on SemEval datasets revealed that not only does bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) outperform regular LSTM, but also word embedding coverage and its source highly affect aspect detection performance. An additional CRF layer consistently improves the results as well.},
